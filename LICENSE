The ili9341 code was modified from Darren Horrocks version to fix command/data/select timing,
as well as removing the GFXFont support.  It was also modified to inherit from Framebuffer
(itself a version modified from analyzing the Damien P. George MicroPython modframebuf.c).

The ili9488 initialization and low-level access code was modeled after the
Waveshare sample code, in which I found the following from the Waveshare team:
